# FOOD-QUALITY-INSPECTION-IN-AGRICULTURE
This project uses computer vision to inspect fruit quality by detecting defects automatically. It processes fruit images to identify damaged or spoiled areas, helping farmers ensure better crop grading and reduce losses, thereby improving food quality control in agricultural supply chains.
Purpose :
The purpose of this project is to create an automated system for inspecting the quality of fruits using image processing. By detecting defects such as bruises and spoilage, the system helps farmers and suppliers quickly identify low-quality produce, reduce waste, and ensure better grading and consistent quality in agricultural products. This improves efficiency and supports sustainable food production.

Technologies used :
The project is primarily built using OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library), a widely-used open-source library for computer vision and image processing. OpenCV provides efficient tools to perform various image manipulation tasks, such as converting images to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur to reduce noise, adaptive thresholding to segment the image, and contour detection to identify defect regions. These functionalities help in isolating and highlighting damaged or defective areas on fruits.

Python is the programming language used due to its simplicity and rich ecosystem of libraries, including OpenCV and NumPy for numerical operations. The combination of these technologies allows rapid development of robust algorithms for automated food quality inspection.

The system processes images by enhancing defect features, making it easier to detect spoilage or bruising that affects the fruit’s quality, thus enabling automated grading and sorting in agricultural practices.

Libraries Used:

OpenCV: For image processing tasks like reading images, converting to grayscale, blurring, thresholding, and detecting contours to identify defects in fruits.

NumPy: For efficient handling of arrays and numerical operations on image data.

(Optional) Matplotlib (if used for displaying images in some environments) — for visualizing images and intermediate processing results.

These libraries together enable effective processing and analysis of fruit images to automate quality inspection.

Usage of the Project:

This project can be used by farmers, agricultural companies, and quality control inspectors to automatically detect defects in fruits. By simply capturing images of the produce, the system analyzes and highlights damaged areas, enabling quick assessment of fruit quality. This helps in sorting, grading, and reducing waste, ensuring only high-quality fruits reach the market, ultimately improving efficiency and profitability in the agricultural supply chain.
